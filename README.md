Mentra Maps Project

We are creating a system through which using the Mentra Live glasses blind people can navigate from Location A -> Location B. They get live feedback through a beeping sound that gets louder as you get closer to a turn. 


TO DOs
- [ ] Get current location streaming
- [ ] Get route from Location 1 -> Location 2 using Google Maps API
- [ ] Write on board logic for how to figure out when you're getting closer to a turn (using longitude & latitude)
